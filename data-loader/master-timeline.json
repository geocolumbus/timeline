Nonetheless, he owned a quarter section of Clinton Township which was named for George Clinton, the vice president in the Adams administration. To attract \"mechanics\" to the area, Alanson, Thomas Bull's oldest son, built houses and shops along what is now High Street, and gave them to anyone with a skill who would stay and practice their craft. The idea caught on and after a time, there was a little hamlet along High Street centered on what today we call Oakland Park.

Any fears were well founded, for this cold front would also leave its mark on the fields. Though not as severe as its predecessors, it did bring extreme cold to Waltham, Massachusetts, and as far south as Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and Richmond, Virginia. Temperatures in the 40 oF range were reported in Connecticut at both Hartford and New Haven. Robbins in East Windsor noted temperatures almost cold enough for a frost.\r\n\r\nThe brunt of this cold air settled in northern New England with frost probably occurring on the uplands or in low-lying areas. In Francona, New Hampshire, the frost was severe enough on the 8th to completely kill the local bean crop. The cold ended on the 9th as morning temperatures of 44 oF at Waltham and 43 oF at Williamstown were reported at 7 am.\r\n\r\nThe combination of cold and drought which had gripped New England for most of the growing season began to elicit fears of a general famine. Estimates of the hay crop were one-third to one-half of that expected--presaging an equivalent reduction in livestock which could be housed over the winter of 1816-17. Reports from Kennebunk, Maine stated that this July frost killed beans, cucumbers and squash."

Earlier that year, the Great Plains states were struck by the Schoolhouse Blizzard that left children trapped in schoolhouses and killed 235 people.  It was known as the \"Great White Hurricane,\" and it paralyzed the East Coast from the Chesapeake Bay to Maine. Telegraph and telephone wires snapped, isolating New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington for several days. Two hundred ships were grounded in port, and at least one hundred sailors died. Fire stations were useless, and property loss from the subsequent fires alone were estimated at $25 million.  The days leading up to the storm were unusually mild, with temperatures in the 40s and 50s along the East Coast of the US. Heavy rains started, and on March 12, 1888, the rain changed to heavy snow, the temperature dropped quickly, and the very strong winds started. The storm spanned 36 hours. The National Weather Service estimated that fifty inches of snow fell in Connecticut and Massachusetts and forty inches covered New York and New Jersey. Winds blew up to 48 miles an hour, creating snowdrifts forty to fifty feet high. The resulting transportation emergency led to the creation of the New York subway, approved in 1894 and begun in 1900."

One major hurdle was convincing major retailers to venture off the main downtown arteries of metropolitan cities and into an unknown concept in merchandising, the regional shopping center. Persistent negotiations between shopping center pioneer Don M. Casto, Sr. and national retailers James Cash Penney and Sebastian Kresge finally landed commitments for stores in this remote suburban location. Their commitments resolved the daunting task of convincing Columbus Railway Power & Light Co., which controlled public transportation at the time, to extend bus service to the suburban shopping center. Casto also insisted on radical innovations for his retailers that were only reluctantly accepted Ð like requiring stores to stay open until 9:00 p.m. six nights a week (since an estimated 70% of sales would be transacted between 5:00 and 9:00 p.m.) and having neon signs that could be seen from the street during all hours of operation.

Later, the President records in his private diary, \"I feel that we must bear a good deal of responsibility for it.\" Saigon celebrates the downfall of Diem's regime. But the coup results in a power vacuum in which a series of military and civilian governments seize control of South Vietnam, a country that becomes totally dependent on the United States for its existence.

At the White House, it is Sunday morning (twelve hours behind Vietnam time). President Johnson, reacting cautiously to reports of the incident, decides against retaliation. Instead, he sends a diplomatic message to Hanoi warning of \"grave consequences\" from any further \"unprovoked\" attacks. Johnson then orders the Maddox to resume operations in the Gulf of Tonkin in the same vicinity where the attack had occurred.

Thus, the first bombing of North Vietnam by the United States occurs as oil facilities and naval targets are attacked without warning by 64 U.S. Navy fighter bombers. \"Our response for the present will be limited and fitting,\" President Johnson tells Americans during a midnight TV appearance, an hour after the attack began. \"We Americans know, although others appear to forget, the risk of spreading conflict. We still seek no wider war.\" Two Navy jets are shot down during the bombing raids, resulting in the first American prisoner of war, Lt.

After each attack, bomb damage along the trail is repaired by female construction crews. During the entire war, the U.S. will fly 3 million sorties and drop nearly 8 million tons of bombs, four times the tonnage dropped during all of World War II, in the largest display of firepower in the history of warfare. The majority of bombs are dropped in South Vietnam against Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army positions, resulting in 3 million civilian refugees due to the destruction of numerous villages. In North Vietnam, military targets include fuel depots and factories. The North Vietnamese react to the air strikes by decentralizing their factories and supply bases, thus minimizing their vulnerability to bomb damage."

A flight attendant first noticed Reid's actions and tried to stop him, but a group of flight attendants and passengers was ultimately needed to subdue the suicide bomber. The flight diverted to Boston where Reid was arrested, and he has since been sentenced to life in prison."

The Tu-154 was carrying 46 people (38 passengers, 8 crew) and reportedly broadcast a hijack warning shortly before crashing. There were no survivors. The attack was also due to a female Chechen suicide bomber named Satsita Dzhebirkhanova. A group named Islambouli Brigade initially claimed responsibility for the two bombings, but leading Chechen terrorist Shamil Basayev denied this and took responsibility for organizing the attack. A week after the two airline attacks, a bomb at the Moscow subway station killed 10 people. Shortly thereafter, the Beslan hostage crisis in September led to the deaths of 335."
