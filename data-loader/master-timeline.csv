While frosts in mid-May are not uncommon in northern New England, May frosts in New Haven, Connecticut are rare--the last frost of spring normally occurring around April 20."
6,5,1816,"Danville, VT: This was perhaps as warm and sultry a day as we have had since September--At night heat lightning was observed, but on Thursday morning the change of weather was so great that a fire was not only comfortable, but actually necessary. The wind during the whole day was as piercing and cold as it usually is the first of November and April. Snow and hail [ice pellets] began to fall about ten o'clock A.M., and the storm continued till evening, accompanied with a brisk wind, which rendered the habiliments of winter necessary for the comfort of those exposed to it....Probably no one living in the country ever witnessed such weather, especially of so long continuance."""
6,7,1816,"A second cold front crossed the region, bringing significant snowfall to the area. From the highlands of Vermont came reports of 5 to 6 inches of snow with drifts to over a foot. At Lunenberg, Vermont, Dr Hiram Cutting measured 5 inches on the ground. Amounts at other locations ranged from ""a plentiful fall"" at Portland, Maine, a foot at Cabot, Vermont, and 6 inches at Barnard, Vermont to ""a few flakes"" at Middlebury, Connecticut, Waltham, Massachusetts and Salem, Massachusetts.

6,22,1816,"With the passing of the arctic air mass into the Atlantic, the temperatures rose to seasonable values for the rest of June. A heat wave from the 22nd to the 24th brought temperatures in excess of 90 oF at Waltham, with a peak of 99 oF the afternoon of the 23rd. Williamstown reached 93 oF on the 24th. The only mention of wintery weather came in reports from St. David, Quebec where severe frosts struck on the 28th and 29th. Optimism re-emerged as replanted vegetable gardens grew quickly under the warm June sun. As the first week of July passed there were hopes of making up for lost time."
7,6,1816,"Williamstown reported a wind shift to northwest with falling temperatures. The arrival of a cold front during July more often than not is a welcomed event in New England. But the memories of earlier weather events must have brought apprehension to those weatherwise to the sign of approaching cold air. Any fears were well founded, for this cold front would also leave its mark on the fields. Though not as severe as its predecessors, it did bring extreme cold to Waltham, Massachusetts, and as far south as Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and Richmond, Virginia. Temperatures in the 40 oF range were reported in Connecticut at both Hartford and New Haven. Robbins in East Windsor noted temperatures almost cold enough for a frost.

The brunt of this cold air settled in northern New England with frost probably occurring on the uplands or in low-lying areas. In Francona, New Hampshire, the frost was severe enough on the 8th to completely kill the local bean crop. The cold ended on the 9th as morning temperatures of 44 oF at Waltham and 43 oF at Williamstown were reported at 7 am.

The combination of cold and drought which had gripped New England for most of the growing season began to elicit fears of a general famine. Estimates of the hay crop were one-third to one-half of that expected--presaging an equivalent reduction in livestock which could be housed over the winter of 1816-17. Reports from Kennebunk, Maine stated that this July frost killed beans, cucumbers and squash."
8,14,1816,"Another series of cold waves would cross New England, forever dashing hopes of a normal harvest. The first wave brought frost to the interior of New York and northern New England on the 13th and 14th of August. Corn was again laid low. New England south of Concord, New Hampshire was given a respite from this invasion, but it was only to last a week."
8,21,1816,"There was a frost, which at Keene and at Chester, N.H., killed a large part of the corn, potatoes, beans, and vines, and also injured many crops in Maine. It was felt as far south as Boston and Middlesex county in eastern Massachusetts...It put an end to the hopes of many farmers of ripening their corn, especially in the low lands, and they immediately cut the whole stalkes [sic] up for fodder, but being in the milk it heated in the shocks and spoiled....If the frost had kept off two weeks longer, there would have been a very good crop of corn in Massachusetts.""

11,1,1963,"Lodge has a routine meeting with Diem from 10 a.m. until noon at the presidential palace, then departs. At 1:30 p.m., during the traditional siesta time, the coup begins as mutinous troops roar into Saigon, surround the presidential palace, and also seize police headquarters. Diem and his brother Nhu are trapped inside the palace and reject all appeals to surrender. Diem telephones the rebel generals and attempts, but fails, to talk them out of the coup. Diem then calls Lodge and asks ""...what is the attitude of the United States?"" Lodge responds ""...it is four thirty a.m. in Washington, and the U.S. government cannot possibly have a view."" Lodge then expresses concern for Diem's safety, to which Diem responds ""I am trying to restore order."" At 8 p.m., Diem and Nhu slip out of the presidential palace unnoticed and go to a safe house in the suburbs that belongs to a wealthy Chinese merchant."
11,2,1963,"At 3 a.m., one of Diem's aides betrays his location to the generals. The hunt for Diem and Nhu now begins. At 6 a.m., Diem telephones the generals. Realizing the situation is hopeless, Diem and Nhu offer to surrender from inside a Catholic church. Diem and Nhu are then taken into custody by rebel officers and placed in the back of an armored personnel carrier. While traveling to Saigon, the vehicle stops and Diem and Nhu are assassinated. At the White House, a meeting is interrupted with the news of Diem's death. According to witnesses, President Kennedy's face turns a ghostly shade of white and he immediately leaves the room. Later, the President records in his private diary, ""I feel that we must bear a good deal of responsibility for it."" Saigon celebrates the downfall of Diem's regime. But the coup results in a power vacuum in which a series of military and civilian governments seize control of South Vietnam, a country that becomes totally dependent on the United States for its existence. Viet Cong use the unstable political situation to increase their hold over the rural population of South Vietnam to nearly 40 percent."

8,2,1964,"Three North Vietnamese patrol boats attack the American destroyer U.S.S. Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin ten miles off the coast of North Vietnam. They fire three torpedoes and machine-guns, but only a single machine-gun round actually strikes the Maddox with no causalities. U.S. Navy fighters from the carrier Ticonderoga, led by Commander James Stockdale, attack the patrol boats, sinking one and damaging the other two. At the White House, it is Sunday morning (twelve hours behind Vietnam time). President Johnson, reacting cautiously to reports of the incident, decides against retaliation. Instead, he sends a diplomatic message to Hanoi warning of ""grave consequences"" from any further ""unprovoked"" attacks. Johnson then orders the Maddox to resume operations in the Gulf of Tonkin in the same vicinity where the attack had occurred. Meanwhile, the Joints Chiefs of Staff put U.S. combat troops on alert and also select targets in North Vietnam for a possible bombing raid, should the need arise. "
8,3,1964,"The Maddox, joined by a second destroyer U.S.S. C. Turner Joy begin a series of vigorous zigzags in the Gulf of Tonkin sailing to within eight miles of North Vietnam's coast, while at the same time, South Vietnamese commandos in speed boats harass North Vietnamese defenses along the coastline. By nightfall, thunderstorms roll in, affecting the accuracy of electronic instruments on the destroyers. Crew members reading their instruments believe they have come under torpedo attack from North Vietnamese patrol boats. Both destroyers open fire on numerous apparent targets but there are no actual sightings of any attacking boats."
8,4,1964,"Although immediate doubts arise concerning the validity of the second attack, the Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly recommend a retaliatory bombing raid against North Vietnam. Press reports in America greatly embellish the second attack with spectacular eyewitness accounts although no journalists had been on board the destroyers. At the White House, President Johnson decides to retaliate. Thus, the first bombing of North Vietnam by the United States occurs as oil facilities and naval targets are attacked without warning by 64 U.S. Navy fighter bombers. ""Our response for the present will be limited and fitting,"" President Johnson tells Americans during a midnight TV appearance, an hour after the attack began. ""We Americans know, although others appear to forget, the risk of spreading conflict. We still seek no wider war."" Two Navy jets are shot down during the bombing raids, resulting in the first American prisoner of war, Lt. Everett Alvarez of San Jose, California, who is taken to an internment center in Hanoi, later dubbed the ""Hanoi Hilton"" by the nearly six hundred American airmen who become POWs."

8,6,1964,"During a meeting in the Senate, McNamara is confronted by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon who had been tipped off by someone in the Pentagon that the Maddox had in fact been involved in the South Vietnamese commando raids against North Vietnam and thus was not the victim of an ""unprovoked"" attack.

8,7,1964,"In response to the two incidents involving the Maddox and Turner Joy, the U.S. Congress, at the behest of President Johnson, overwhelmingly passes the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution put forward by the White House allowing the President ""to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force"" to prevent further attacks against U.S. forces. The Resolution, passed unanimously in the House and 98-2 in the Senate, grants enormous power to President Johnson to wage an undeclared war in Vietnam from the White House. The only Senators voting against the Resolution are Wayne Morse, and Ernest Gruening of Alaska who said ""all Vietnam is not worth the life of a single American boy."""

Matters came to a head during a Politburo Standing Committee meeting at Deng's residence.[44] At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.[70] Li Peng, Yao Yilin and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech to the Asian Development Bank on 4 May, Zhao exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.[70][71][72] Deng warned that ""there is no way to back down now without the situation spiraling out of control"", and so ""the decision is to move troops into Beijing to declare martial law""[73] as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance."

At about 10:00 p.m., the 38th Army opened fire on protesters at the Wukesong intersection on Chang'an Avenue, about 10 km west of Square. Around 3000 civilians died."
6,5,1989,"In China, the suppression of the protest was immortalized outside of China via video footage and photographs of a lone man standing in front of a column of tanks leaving Tiananmen Square via Chang'an Avenue. The ""Tank Man"", as it became known, became one of the most iconic photographs in the 20th century. As the tank driver tried to go around him, the ""Tank Man"" moved into the tank's path. He continued to stand defiantly in front of the tanks for some time, then climbed up onto the turret of the lead tank to speak to the soldiers inside. After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people."
